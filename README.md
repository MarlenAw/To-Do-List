# To-Do App

### Using TDD to build a To-do app

  * This project is split into three parts:

  1. Using TDD to create the logic needed to modify my to-do list. This code will not interact with the DOM and it is found in test.js 
  2. Render the to-do list to the DOM
  3. Adding my own features
  
# The Project

### User stories:

  As a disorganised person I want to:
  
  * enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them
  * view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day
  * mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left
